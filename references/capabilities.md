# Recipient capability checks
At setup, inspect the recipient's own agent, installed connectors, selected accounts, permissions, and tool schemas. That environment determines what Email Butler can do. Checks on the developer's accounts do not verify the recipient's setup. Use the public documentation below as dated research pointers, not as installed-feature tests or hard-coded platform limits.

## Outlook checks to perform during setup
| Capability | Evidence | Shipping posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archive or move a message to an arbitrary mail folder | Absent from the published Microsoft 365 read/write tool tables; category changes are distinct from folder moves | Unverified; never advertise full filing support without an actual tool/schema and approved test |
| Create an inbox rule | outlook_create_filter is documented | Documented; account permission/schema/readback still required |
| Delete an inbox rule | outlook_delete_filter is documented | Documented; do not claim safe removal without exact ID and absence verification |
| List/get rules with criteria, actions, exceptions, and ordering | No rule-list/get tool documented; read_resource is described as reading files, emails, or chat by URI | Unverified; generic read_resource is not evidence of arbitrary Graph access |
| Categories | Creation, rename/delete, and message/thread/batch category changes are documented | Supported in principle; verify actual enabled tools and account |

Public documentation checked on 2026-10-31 is incomplete: the directory lists seven read tools while the security guide documents additional writes. A catalog omission does not establish that a feature is absent from the recipient's installation. Inspect actual exposed schemas after the requested connector has been installed and connected. Do not query the developer's account as a substitute or create a custom authentication setup just to enumerate tools.

Setup should attempt the supported connector route and report the recipient's actual result. Continue useful supported work when an action is unavailable, and surface only the limitation that matters to the requested operation. A safe native-rule lifecycle needs inspection, exact-ID removal, and readback as well as creation.

## Other relevant capabilities
Claude's Gmail directory documents create_filter and list_filters, label creation/application/removal, and spam rescue. Its public list does not establish filter deletion. Gmail archive is removal of the INBOX system label, supported by the documented unlabel_thread schema. Some advanced Gmail filters are unsupported and attachment bodies are unavailable through Claude's Gmail connector.

The offline classifier in scripts/capabilities.py recognizes a bounded set of known tool names. It is a starting point for schema inspection, not a complete connector catalog. Unknown names and missing mappings require checking the recipient's actual tools. They do not establish permanent feature absence, permissions, successful execution, or setup readiness.

## Recipient acceptance probe
During setup in the recipient's Claude or Codex agent, inspect the actual Microsoft 365/Outlook connector tools and resource templates without changing mail. Determine whether the available tools can move/archive a message, list/get inbox rules with their criteria/actions/ordering, create a rule, and delete a rule. Retain exact exposed names and schema fields privately, with unavailable and unknown kept distinct. Do not call a write tool or invent a Graph URI. Distinguish exposed support from a successful read or write test. Present the user with the short practical result; keep the technical inventory for the agent.

The inventory can settle exposed tool support. Identity checks and read-only rule inspection can settle read permission. An exact approved synthetic-message/rule cycle is still needed for write/readback verification. Do not create an uninspectable rule as a capability probe.
